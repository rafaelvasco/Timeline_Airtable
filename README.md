- What you like about your implementation:

  - Visuals, zooming and panning, organized code.

- What you would change if you were going to do it again.

  - Focus more on component UX.
  - Fix zooming to keep content focused where it was before.

- How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that.

  - Looked at Airtable Timeline images for inspiration. Tried to position myself in the user position for UX perspective.

- How you would test this if you had more time.

  - Manual testing (different browsers)
  - AI Based Testing (automated AI interacting with the DOM directly)
  - Automated unit tests with Jest
  - Integration tests with other components/pages
  - Accessibility tests
  - Perf Test on Chrome Console
  - Real Users Test Sessions
